    ''' Unmix the traces of all neurons using NMF, and obtain the unmixed traces and the mixing matrix. 
    Inputs: 
        traces (numpy.ndarray of float, shape = (T,n)): The raw traces of all neurons.
            Each column represents a trace of a neuron, which can be a trace of F, dF/F, or SNR.
        bgtraces (numpy.ndarray of float, shape = (T,n)): All the raw background traces.
            Each column represents a background trace corresponding to a neuron.
        outtraces (numpy.ndarray of float, shape = (T,n)): The raw traces of all the outside activities.
            Each column represents an outside trace corresponding to a neuron.
        list_neighbors (list of list of int): 
            Each element is a list of indeces of neighboring neurons of a neuron.
        list_alpha (list of float, default to [0]): A list of alpha to be tested.
            The elements should be sorted in ascending order.
        Qclip (float, default to 0): Traces lower than this quantile are clipped to this quantile value.
            Qclip = 0 means no clipping is applied. 
        th_pertmin (float, default to 1): Maximum pertentage of unmixed traces equaling to the trace minimum.
            th_pertmin = 1 means no requirement is applied. 
        epsilon (float, default to 0): The minimum value of the input traces after scaling and shifting. 
        th_residual (float, default to 0): If not zero, The redisual of unmixing should be smaller than this value.
        nbin (int, default to 1): The temporal downsampling ratio.
            nbin = 1 means temporal downsampling is not used.
        bin_option (str, can be 'downsample' (default), 'sum', or 'mean'): 
            The method of temporal downsampling. 
            'downsample' means keep one frame and discard "nbin" - 1 frames for every "nbin" frames.
            'sum' means each binned frame is the sum of continuous "nbin" frames.
            'mean' means each binned frame is the mean of continuous "nbin" frames.
        flexible_alpha (bool, default to True): Whether a flexible alpha strategy is used 
            when the smallest alpha in "list_alpha" already caused over-regularization.
            False means the final alpha is the smallest element in "list_alpha".
            True means trying to recursively divide the smallest alpha by 2 until no over-regularization exists.

    Outputs:
        demix (numpy.ndarray of float, shape = (T,n)): The resulting unmixed traces. 
            Each column is the unmixed trace of a neuron.
        list_mixout (list of numpy.ndarray of float, shape = (n1,n1)): 
            Each element is the row-normalized mixing matrix for the NMF of each neuron.
        list_alpha_final (list of float): Each element is the final chosen alpha for the NMF of each neuron. 
            It might be one of the elements in "list_alpha", or a value smaller than the first element.
        list_MSE (list of numpy.ndarray of float, shape = (n1,)): 
            Each element is the mean squared error (NMF residual) between 
            the input traces and the NMF-reconstructed traces for the NMF of each neuron.
        list_n_iter (list of int): Each element is the number of iterations 
            to achieve NMF convergence for the NMF of each neuron.
